# portfolioSimulations
Run Portfolio Monte Carlo Simulations

Steps to execute
This is a maven. So run the following commands
1. mvn clean
2. mvn clean package
3. from the root folder, java -jar portfoliosimulations-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar


Do note that I have run this from Main with the values set for this question.

Enhancements:
1. Create a config file for the tests and make a collection of portfolios
2. The MCSimulations class can accept more than one portfolio class
3. Parallelise the execution of the years with a future
